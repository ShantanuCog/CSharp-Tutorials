Exercise: Student Grade Calculator in C#
Objective
Create a C# console application that calculates student grades and class averages, applying your knowledge of variables, data types, loops, conditionals, methods (functions), and lists.

Requirements
You will build a simple console application that manages student grades. Your application should:

Store each student’s name and their scores.
Calculate each student’s average score.
Assign each student a letter grade based on their average:
A: 90–100
B: 80–89
C: 70–79
D: 60–69
F: Below 60
Print a clear summary showing each student's name, scores, average, and letter grade.
Calculate and print:
The overall class average.
The highest-scoring student's name and average.
The lowest-scoring student's name and average.
Starter Code
Below is incomplete starter code. Your task is to complete the methods and logic clearly marked with // TODO.

Program.cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Student Grade Management System");
        Console.WriteLine("===============================\n");

        // Sample student data
        List<string> studentNames = new List<string> { "Alex", "Taylor", "Jordan" };
        List<List<int>> studentScores = new List<List<int>> {
            new List<int> {95, 88, 92, 85},
            new List<int> {78, 81, 74, 70},
            new List<int> {62, 67, 69, 64}
        };

        // TODO: Calculate averages and print each student's summary
        for (int i = 0; i < studentScores.Count; i++)
        {
            string studentName = studentNames[i];
            List<int> scores = studentScores[i];

            double average = CalculateAverage(scores); // TODO
            char letterGrade = GetLetterGrade(average); // TODO

            // TODO: Print student details clearly (name, scores, average, letter grade)
        }

        // TODO: Compute and print class statistics:
        // - Class average
        // - Highest scoring student
        // - Lowest scoring student
    }

    // TODO: Method to calculate the average score from a list of integers
    static double CalculateAverage(List<int> scores)
    {
        // Implement calculation here
    }

    // TODO: Method to determine the letter grade based on average score
    static char GetLetterGrade(double average)
    {
        // Implement logic here
    }

    // Optional additional methods for class average, highest, and lowest scores
}
Expected Output
When completed correctly, your output will look like this:

Student Grade Management System
===============================

Alex
Scores: 95, 88, 92, 85
Average: 90.0
Grade: A

Taylor
Scores: 78, 81, 74, 70
Average: 75.8
Grade: C

Jordan
Scores: 62, 67, 69, 64
Average: 65.5
Grade: D

===============================
Class Average: 77.1
Highest Average: Alex (90.0)
Lowest Average: Jordan (65.5)
Hints:
Use loops (for, foreach) to iterate through arrays or lists.
Separate each calculation into its own method clearly.
Use conditional statements (if-else) to determine letter grades.
You can format strings easily with:
Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}, your average is {average}");
Optionally, handle edge cases, such as empty lists, gracefully.
Evaluation Criteria:
Correct calculation of averages.
Accurate assignment of letter grades.
Correct usage of loops, conditionals, and methods.
Clear, readable, and organized code.
